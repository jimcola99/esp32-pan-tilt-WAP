ESP-32 Cam Pan/Tilt with Laser With Web Access Point
This is the same code as my other upload but has its own Web Access Point instead of attaching to an existing wireless network.
Connect Via WIFI.  Use Fing to find IP.  Connect to IP via browser.  

The other version that connects to an existing WIFI access point is here.
